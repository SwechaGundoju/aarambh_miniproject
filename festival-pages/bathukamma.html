    <h1>Bathukamma Festival</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Bathukamma is an ancient floral festival celebrated predominantly in Telangana.
The word "Bathukamma" means 'Mother Goddess, come alive!' in Telugu.
It honors Goddess Gauri (a form of Durga) and symbolizes life, fertility, and womanhood.
According to legend, a Chola king's daughter, who was reborn after prayers to Goddess Lakshmi, was named Bathukamma.
The festival is believed to have started as a way to worship nature and thank the Earth for its bounty.
It is traditionally celebrated during Navratri and marks the return of women to their maternal homes.
Over the centuries, Bathukamma has become a symbol of Telangana's cultural pride and unity.</p>

    <h2>Significance</h2>
    <p>Batukamma celebrates the inherent relationship between earth, water and the human beings. During the entire preceding week, women make ‘boddemma’ (a deity of Gowri – mother Durga – made with earthly mud) along with Batukamma and immerse it in the pond. This helps reinforce the ponds and helps it retain more water. The flowers used in Batukamma have a great quality of purifying water and such flowers when immersed in abundance into the pond have the effect of cleansing the water and making the environment much better. In times where the fresh water ponds are gradually diminishing and dwindling away it is indeed a pride of Telangana that its womenfolk (with mostly agrarian background) inherently know how to make them better by celebrating the beauty of nature. It is something we indeed have to feel proud of. The festival heralds the beauty of nature, collective spirit of Telangana people, the indomitable spirit of women folks and also the scientific approach of the agrarian people towards preserving the resources of nature in a celebrative way. Hence, Bathukamma is the icon of cultural identity of Telangana.</p>

    <h2>Rituals and Traditions</h2>
    <p>Women create flower stacks using native blooms like thangedu, gunuka, banti, and chamanti. These are arranged in a tapering, temple-like structure. Dressed in traditional sarees, women sing folk songs and dance around the Bathukamma. On the final day, the arrangements are immersed in lakes or rivers with prayers for health and happiness.
        Bathukamma is a hindu flower-festival celebrated by the women of Telangana and some parts of Andhra Pradesh. Every year this festival is celebrated as per the Sathavahana calendar for nine days starting on Pitru Amavasya, which usually coincides with the months September–October of the Gregorian calendar. Bathukamma is celebrated for nine days and corresponds to the festivals of Sharad Navratri and Durga Puja. It starts on the day of Mahalaya Amavasya and the 9-day festivities culminate on "Saddula Bathukamma" or "Pedda Bathukamma." Bathukamma is followed by Boddemma, which is a 7-day festival. The Boddemma festival that marks the ending of Varsha Ruthu whereas Bathukamma marks the beginning of Sarad or Sharath Ruthu.
