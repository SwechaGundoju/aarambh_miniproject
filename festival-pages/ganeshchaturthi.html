    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
  Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as <b>Vinayaka Chavithi</b>, is a Hindu festival celebrating the birth of <b>Lord Ganesha</b> — the remover of obstacles and god of wisdom. The tradition of public celebration was popularized by <b>Bal Gangadhar Tilak</b> in the 19th century during India's independence movement, as a way to bring communities together. Over time, the festival grew into a grand public event with beautifully crafted idols and elaborate rituals.

  Although the exact origin of Ganesh Chaturthi is <b>uncertain</b>, it has been <b>publicly celebrated in Pune</b> since the time of <b>King Shivaji</b> (1630–1680), founder of the <b>Maratha Empire</b>. In the 18th century, the <b>Peshwas</b>, who were devotees of Ganesha, promoted it as a public festival during the <b>Bhadrapada</b> month.

  During the <b>British rule</b>, the festival lost its <b>state patronage</b> and became a <b>private family celebration</b> in Maharashtra. It was later <b>revived by freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak</b> in <b>1892</b>, who transformed it into a <b>mass public event</b> to bypass British restrictions on Hindu gatherings. Major celebrations began in <b>Pune</b> and <b>Girgaon, Mumbai</b>.
</p>


    <h2>Significance</h2>
    <p>
  The festival of <b>Ganesh Chaturthi</b> marks the joyous arrival of <b>Lord Ganesha</b> from <b>Kailash Parvat</b> to Earth, accompanied by his divine mother, <b>Goddess Parvati</b>. It signifies not just a religious occasion, but also the deeper spiritual meaning of the <b>cycle of birth, life, and death</b>. Devotees welcome Lord Ganesha into their homes and hearts with immense devotion, believing that his presence brings <b>prosperity, wisdom, and protection</b>.

  One of the most symbolic aspects of the festival is the <b>Ganesh Visarjan</b> — the immersion of the idol into a water body. This act represents the <b>transience of life</b> and the idea of letting go. It is widely believed that when Lord Ganesha departs, he carries away all the <b>sorrows, negativities, and obstacles</b> from the lives of his devotees, leaving behind peace and renewed hope.

  The days leading to the immersion are filled with <b>prayers, aartis, bhajans</b>, and cultural performances. Communities unite to decorate pandals, share sweets like <b>modaks</b> (Lord Ganesha’s favorite), and participate in the collective celebration of faith and joy. Every year, people wait with <b>great anticipation and love</b> for Ganesh Chaturthi, cherishing the divine energy and unity it brings into their lives and surroundings.

    <h2>Rituals and Traditions</h2>
    <p>
      The celebrations begin with the installation of clay idols of Ganesha at homes and in public pandals (temporary structures). Devotees offer modaks, laddus, durva grass, red hibiscus flowers, and coconut to the deity. Daily prayers, bhajans, and aarti are performed during the 10-day celebration.

The Marathi aarti <i>“Sukhakarta Dukhaharta”</i>, composed by <b>Samarth Ramdas</b>, is traditionally sung. The immersion (Visarjan) is done after <b>1.5, 3, 5, 7, or 11 days</b>.
